# Milestone 4 - Finalizing your dashboard


## 2. Expectations for working collaboratively on GitHub
 For this part we created so many PR and collaborate all of our challenges there. We also created issues for each task and assign them to the group members. We also created a project board to track the progress of our tasks.

## 3. Address feedback from me and your peers

Feedbacks From Professros:
- fix the table and make the line graph shorter so you won't have scrolling based on ( issiues #51)
- The professor advised us to "add caching to your project to optimize performance and reduce computation time, especially for expensive or repetitive tasks. (Based on PR#53)

Feedbacks from our Peers
- Removed "DSCI_553" from the "About" section based on (PR Fixing issues #55)
- Add a tooltip or something to indicate the country name (based on issues #48)
- Data not showing up on Render based on (issiues #52)
- Add description for date filter (based on issiues #49)



## 4. Performance improvements
- Use a binary format for loading data faster
- Have no redundant filtering/mutating of the data in the app
   Create a processed data file that is loaded in the app instead (stored in data/processed).
- Have no excessively slow computation that could be easily sped up, e.g. no row-wise use of apply unless well justified and optimized.
Use caching for at least one function



## 5. App refinement


## 6. Smaller fixes and touch-ups


## 7. Reflection


## 8. Set up tests and write docstrings (Optional)
