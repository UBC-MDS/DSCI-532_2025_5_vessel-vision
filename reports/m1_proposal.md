# **Vessel Vision Dashboard Proposal**

## **1. Motivation and Purpose**
### **Project Background**
We are a team of data science students at UBC, working on an interactive dashboard as part of our DSCI 532 course. Our goal is to build a **Vancouver AIS Vessel Tracking Dashboard** to enable real-time and historical analysis of ship movements in and around Vancouver. 

### **Target Audience**
Our dashboard is designed for:
- **Port of Vancouver Authorities**: To monitor vessel congestion, optimize port operations, and track vessel movement.
- **Shipping and Logistics Companies**: To track cargo ship arrivals/departures for supply chain efficiency.
- **Marine Researchers and Environmental Analysts**: To study shipping patterns and assess their environmental impact.
- **Coast Guard and Security Agencies**: To enhance maritime security and respond to potential threats.

### **Problem Statement**
The maritime industry in Vancouver requires real-time access to vessel movement data for decision-making. Traditional tools lack **interactive visualizations** and **custom filtering**, making it difficult to analyze trends efficiently. Our dashboard will address this gap by providing an intuitive and interactive platform to explore AIS (Automatic Identification System) data.

## **2. Description of the Data**
The dataset used in this project comes from the **NOAA AIS Data Archive**, specifically from [this source](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zxJuSRigLEg4iY1pnUgW-Z49s2TEKEip?usp=sharing). This dataset provides USA national AIS data, including vessel movements in and around Vancouver, Canada. The dataset focuses on two specific dates:

December 31, 2023 (New Year's Eve)

January 1, 2024 (New Year's Day)

These dates were selected due to the heightened shipping activity typically observed around the year-end, driven by operational surges and year-end deadlines. It contains attributes such as:
- **MMSI (Maritime Mobile Service Identity)** â€“ Unique vessel identifier
- **BaseDateTime** â€“ Timestamp of the data entry
- **LAT, LON** â€“ Latitude and Longitude (vessel position)
- **SOG (Speed Over Ground)** â€“ Speed in knots
- **COG (Course Over Ground)** â€“ Direction of vessel movement
- **Heading** â€“ Vesselâ€™s actual heading
- **VesselName** â€“ Name of the ship
- **IMO, CallSign** â€“ Additional ship identifiers
- **VesselType** â€“ Cargo, Passenger, Tanker, etc.
- **Length, Width, Draft** â€“ Vessel dimensions
- **Cargo Type** â€“ Type of cargo being transported

### **Planned Data Processing and Feature Engineering**
- **Geographic Filtering**: Select only vessels **within the Vancouver region** (LAT ~49, LON ~-123).
- **Time-Based Trends**: Analyze vessel movement patterns over different time periods.
- **Vessel Traffic Density**: Visualize congested areas in the port.
- **Derived Variables**: Compute daily vessel counts, speed distributions, and time spent in certain zones.

## **3. Research Questions and Usage Scenarios**
### **Research Questions**
- How many vessels are active in Vancouver at different times of the day, week, and month?
- What are the most common vessel types navigating Vancouver waters?
- How does vessel speed and movement pattern vary across different zones?
- Where are the most congested areas in Vancouverâ€™s waterways, and how does traffic density change over time?
- How does vessel movement on December 31, 2023, compare to January 1, 2024?
- How many vessels arrived and departed from Vancouver ports during December 2023 and January 2024?
- What is the total number of unique vessels recorded in the dataset?
- How many vessels were anchored, and where were the most common anchoring locations?
- What was the maximum time a vessel remained anchored on a given? 

### **User Story: Port Operations Manager**
> John is a port operations manager responsible for overseeing vessel traffic at the Port of Vancouver. He is particularly interested in analyzing vessel congestion for December 2023 and January 2024. Using the dashboard, he filters the data for this timeframe and selects the current date to view a heatmap of vessel density. He notices high congestion near Burrard Inlet, prompting him to schedule additional tugboats to assist incoming cargo ships. Additionally, he downloads a weekly report summarizing vessel arrivals and departures for these two months, which helps him optimize berthing schedules.

### **User Story: Marine Researcher**
> Lisa is an environmental researcher studying the **impact of vessel traffic on marine life in December 2023 and January 2024**. She accesses the dashboard to explore **historical ship movement patterns**. By filtering the data for specific vessel types (tankers, cargo ships), she identifies areas with **high shipping frequency** near protected marine zones. This insight helps her advocate for new **conservation policies** and designated no-go zones to protect marine biodiversity.
