    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "The dataset used in this extraction process originates from the **National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)**. NOAA is a scientific agency within the United States Department of Commerce that focuses on the conditions of the oceans, major waterways, and the atmosphere.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, we have extracted **Automatic Identification System (AIS) data** for two specific dates:\n",
    "\n",
    "- December 31, 2023 (New Year's Eve)\n",
    "\n",
    "- January 1, 2024 (New Year's Day)\n",
    "\n",
    "These dates were chosen due to increased shipping activity at the year's end, influenced by year-end deadlines and operational surges in maritime traffic.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. About AIS Data\n",
    "\n",
    "AIS (Automatic Identification System) is an automatic tracking system used on ships and by vessel traffic services (VTS) to identify and locate vessels. It is widely used for navigation, safety, and maritime traffic monitoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Fields in AIS Data:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **MMSI**: Unique identifier for the vessel.  \n",
    "- **Timestamp**: The date and time of the AIS message.  \n",
    "- **Latitude & Longitude**: The geographical position of the vessel.  \n",
    "- **Speed (knots)**: Speed of the vessel over ground.  \n",
    "- **Course (degrees)**: Direction of the vessel.  \n",
    "- **Heading (degrees)**: The actual heading of the vessel.  \n",
    "- **Ship Type**: Classification of the vessel type (cargo, tanker, fishing, etc.).  \n",
    "\n",
    "## AIS Data Download & Processing  \n",
    "\n",
    "The AIS data has already been downloaded from NOAA and is available on the following public Google Drive link:  \n",
    "[Download AIS Data](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zxJuSRigLEg4iY1pnUgW-Z49s2TEKEip?usp=sharing)  \n",
    "\n",
    "If the data is not available on NoAA, you can download it from the link above \n",
    "\n",
    "You can also get these files directly from NOAA:  \n",
    "- [Download AIS Data 2023](https://www.coast.noaa.gov/htdata/CMSP/AISDataHandler/2023/index.html)  \n",
    "- [Download AIS Data 2024](https://coast.noaa.gov/htdata/CMSP/AISDataHandler/2024/index.html)  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Instructions for Manual Download**  \n",
    "If you download the data manually, Please create a `raw` folder inside the `data` directory of this project and place the downloaded files there. Then, run the preprocessing script to process the data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Automated Processing**  \n",
    "If you have not manually downloaded the data, the following Python script will automate everything for you by downloading and organizing the files in the required structure.  "
